  About

       
AND Architecture + Community Planning utilizes its expertise in architecture design, planning and engagement services to support and enhance community-based nonprofits, lower-income, and underserved communities by starting with the neighborhood and organizational priorities and needs first. All projects begin with a process that engages those who are involved or affected by the project or issue as co-designers. We advocate and educate for spatial equality that supports justice and human dignity.
 
Our History
 

AND was founded in 1973 by a group of Architecture Students from UC Berkeley who wanted to use their design talents with the goal of improving living conditions in San Francisco’s and Oakland’s Chinatown. They began their work by volunteering and making design improvements to living and communal spaces within low-income Asian neighborhoods in the Bay Area. Over the years, AND expanded its services to low-income multiethnic communities throughout the greater Bay Area based on the belief that communities deserve to live in a socially, economically, and environmentally healthy community. What started as a volunteer-based nonprofit 43 years ago, is now a nationally recognized nonprofit organization for its dedication to community-based services and for its design sensitivity to community concerns. We have received recognition both in the community and in the architecture profession for the quality of their services.
We welcome you to learn more about AND’s rich history of dedication to assisting San Francisco Bay Area individuals and communities by reading “Construction for Empowerment, Design for Social Change”, a compilation of AND projects from 1973-2013.

Our History
 

AND was founded in 1973 by a group of Architecture Students from UC Berkeley who wanted to use their design talents with the goal of improving living conditions in San Francisco’s and Oakland’s Chinatown. They began their work by volunteering and making design improvements to living and communal spaces within low-income Asian neighborhoods in the Bay Area. Over the years, AND expanded its services to low-income multiethnic communities throughout the greater Bay Area based on the belief that communities deserve to live in a socially, economically, and environmentally healthy community. What started as a volunteer-based nonprofit 43 years ago, is now a nationally recognized nonprofit organization for its dedication to community-based services and for its design sensitivity to community concerns. We have received recognition both in the community and in the architecture profession for the quality of their services.

  About

       
AND Architecture + Community Planning utilizes its expertise in architecture design, planning and engagement services to support and enhance community-based nonprofits, lower-income, and underserved communities by starting with the neighborhood and organizational priorities and needs first. All projects begin with a process that engages those who are involved or affected by the project or issue as co-designers. We advocate and educate for spatial equality that supports justice and human dignity.
 
Our History
 

AND was founded in 1973 by a group of Architecture Students from UC Berkeley who wanted to use their design talents with the goal of improving living conditions in San Francisco’s and Oakland’s Chinatown. They began their work by volunteering and making design improvements to living and communal spaces within low-income Asian neighborhoods in the Bay Area. Over the years, AND expanded its services to low-income multiethnic communities throughout the greater Bay Area based on the belief that communities deserve to live in a socially, economically, and environmentally healthy community. What started as a volunteer-based nonprofit 43 years ago, is now a nationally recognized nonprofit organization for its dedication to community-based services and for its design sensitivity to community concerns. We have received recognition both in the community and in the architecture profession for the quality of their services.
We welcome you to learn more about AND’s rich history of dedication to assisting San Francisco Bay Area individuals and communities by reading “Construction for Empowerment, Design for Social Change”, a compilation of AND projects from 1973-2013.

  About

       
AND Architecture + Community Planning utilizes its expertise in architecture design, planning and engagement services to support and enhance community-based nonprofits, lower-income, and underserved communities by starting with the neighborhood and organizational priorities and needs first. All projects begin with a process that engages those who are involved or affected by the project or issue as co-designers. We advocate and educate for spatial equality that supports justice and human dignity.
 
Our History
 

AND was founded in 1973 by a group of Architecture Students from UC Berkeley who wanted to use their design talents with the goal of improving living conditions in San Francisco’s and Oakland’s Chinatown. They began their work by volunteering and making design improvements to living and communal spaces within low-income Asian neighborhoods in the Bay Area. Over the years, AND expanded its services to low-income multiethnic communities throughout the greater Bay Area based on the belief that communities deserve to live in a socially, economically, and environmentally healthy community. What started as a volunteer-based nonprofit 43 years ago, is now a nationally recognized nonprofit organization for its dedication to community-based services and for its design sensitivity to community concerns. We have received recognition both in the community and in the architecture profession for the quality of their services.
We welcome you to learn more about AND’s rich history of dedication to assisting San Francisco Bay Area individuals and communities by reading “Construction for Empowerment, Design for Social Change”, a compilation of AND projects from 1973-2013.

  About

       
AND Architecture + Community Planning utilizes its expertise in architecture design, planning and engagement services to support and enhance community-based nonprofits, lower-income, and underserved communities by starting with the neighborhood and organizational priorities and needs first. All projects begin with a process that engages those who are involved or affected by the project or issue as co-designers. We advocate and educate for spatial equality that supports justice and human dignity.
 
Our History
 

AND was founded in 1973 by a group of Architecture Students from UC Berkeley who wanted to use their design talents with the goal of improving living conditions in San Francisco’s and Oakland’s Chinatown. They began their work by volunteering and making design improvements to living and communal spaces within low-income Asian neighborhoods in the Bay Area. Over the years, AND expanded its services to low-income multiethnic communities throughout the greater Bay Area based on the belief that communities deserve to live in a socially, economically, and environmentally healthy community. What started as a volunteer-based nonprofit 43 years ago, is now a nationally recognized nonprofit organization for its dedication to community-based services and for its design sensitivity to community concerns. We have received recognition both in the community and in the architecture profession for the quality of their services.
We welcome you to learn more about AND’s rich history of dedication to assisting San Francisco Bay Area individuals and communities by reading “Construction for Empowerment, Design for Social Change”, a compilation of AND projects from 1973-2013.

  About

       
AND Architecture + Community Planning utilizes its expertise in architecture design, planning and engagement services to support and enhance community-based nonprofits, lower-income, and underserved communities by starting with the neighborhood and organizational priorities and needs first. All projects begin with a process that engages those who are involved or affected by the project or issue as co-designers. We advocate and educate for spatial equality that supports justice and human dignity.
 
Our History
 

AND was founded in 1973 by a group of Architecture Students from UC Berkeley who wanted to use their design talents with the goal of improving living conditions in San Francisco’s and Oakland’s Chinatown. They began their work by volunteering and making design improvements to living and communal spaces within low-income Asian neighborhoods in the Bay Area. Over the years, AND expanded its services to low-income multiethnic communities throughout the greater Bay Area based on the belief that communities deserve to live in a socially, economically, and environmentally healthy community. What started as a volunteer-based nonprofit 43 years ago, is now a nationally recognized nonprofit organization for its dedication to community-based services and for its design sensitivity to community concerns. We have received recognition both in the community and in the architecture profession for the quality of their services.

  About

       
AND Architecture + Community Planning utilizes its expertise in architecture design, planning and engagement services to support and enhance community-based nonprofits, lower-income, and underserved communities by starting with the neighborhood and organizational priorities and needs first. All projects begin with a process that engages those who are involved or affected by the project or issue as co-designers. We advocate and educate for spatial equality that supports justice and human dignity.
 
Our History
 

AND was founded in 1973 by a group of Architecture Students from UC Berkeley who wanted to use their design talents with the goal of improving living conditions in San Francisco’s and Oakland’s Chinatown. They began their work by volunteering and making design improvements to living and communal spaces within low-income Asian neighborhoods in the Bay Area. Over the years, AND expanded its services to low-income multiethnic communities throughout the greater Bay Area based on the belief that communities deserve to live in a socially, economically, and environmentally healthy community. What started as a volunteer-based nonprofit 43 years ago, is now a nationally recognized nonprofit organization for its dedication to community-based services and for its design sensitivity to community concerns.
