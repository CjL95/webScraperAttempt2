    Comprehensive Neighborhood Planning
We believe that the people who live, work, and play in a place are the ones who should lead the process of shaping how development happens: what are the sacred places that should be preserved, what needs to be strengthened or enhanced, and what new things need to be brought into a neighborhood to facilitate equitable community and economic development for all?
 

Northeast Water Front Community Plan 
As San Francisco’s Waterfront continues to develop, it is critical that the cultural character and resources that make the waterfront special be maintained and enhanced. In 2010, residents, youth and seniors, local merchants, and tenant and neighborhood organizations from San Francisco’s Northeast Waterfront together created a Vision that emerged from this diverse community’s desire for a comprehensive plan that addresses issues not emphasized by official City planning processes. This document presents a Vision of the Northeast Waterfront as a necklace of intimate green spaces, between a low-rise mix of commercial, residential, cultural, and recreational uses that honor the Waterfront’s history and topography, connected back to the City’s neighborhoods through strong pedestrian-friendly streets. The community planning process that led to this Vision was guided by several principles developed by the community:

Begin with People      and Place,      not abstract planning “concepts.” Sense      of place is defined by the people who live, work and play in a      particular place. The      waterfront is not just a destination, but also part of neighborhood fabric      of Golden Gateway, Chinatown, North Beach, and Telegraph Hill. Strengthen      neighborhood connections, including the cultural/ethnic relationship      between Chinatown and waterfront. Public      improvements and private development should integrate with and contribute      to existing neighborhood fabric along the Northeast Waterfront.
Plan for a      harmonious, socio-economic and ethnically diverse waterfront. Take a comprehensive look at planning for      people, including Transit,      Parking, Recreation, Economics, and Equity issues. Development should be accessible to all, including      residents, visitors and those who work nearby. Affordable housing should      be a priority for both families and seniors. 
Enhance and preserve      the community’s recreation opportunities, especially the recreation, education and cultural performance      needs of Chinatown and North Beach youth; and preserve the Gateway’s      recreation center as the community resource it was designed to be.
Plan for the future      of the NE Waterfront as a whole, not just      priorities for developers. Balance uses that      are revenue-generating with public open space and active recreation uses across      all the Northeast Waterfront’s Seawall Lots in order to produce a plan      that is both financially and politically feasible.
Reach      Consensus from a wide range of stakeholders representing the interests of residents,      workers, merchants, youth and seniors from the different communities of      the Northeast Waterfront, as well as visitors and downtown workers.

Western SoMa Community Plan 
 The Western South of Market Citizens Planning Task Force seeks to maintain and enhance the living, historic and sustainable neighborhood character of Western SoMa’s cultural and economic diversity. AND worked closely with the Task Force and Planning Department staff in the development of the Community Plan, providing facilitation, analysis, and mapping necessary for a comprehensive plan, as well as developing a set of “Strategic Analysis Memos” to support the plan. >Download Western SoMa Draft Plan (pdf) 

 
SoMa Youth & Family Zone 
AND has worked in partnership with SOMCAN over many years, providing impacts analysis of the Rincon Hill developments that led to the creation of a $34 Million SoMa Community Stabilization Fund, and our ongoing collaboration to help build the vision for the Youth & Family Zone. This vision lays out how the community can grow and benefit from the rapid development hap­pening in SoMa, addressing the needs of local families for affordable housing, jobs for youth and young adults, pedestrian safety, open space, and community-serving businesses, incorporating a broad definition of families to include extended, senior, non-traditional, and LGBTQ families

Mission District People's Plan
The People's Plan for Jobs, Housing & Community, developed with the  Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition, proposes an alternative for the Planning Department's "Eastern Neighborhoods" project. Developed through a participatory planning process involving over 200 community residents and intensive community organizing, the plan outlines goals and objectives for protecting existing rent-controlled housing, blue-collar jobs, and critical services and cultural resources, and promoting affordable housing and equitable development. AND provided supporting research and documents for the People’s Plan, which was analyzed as a plan alternative in the city’s EIR, and continues to work with Mission organizations in the implementation of the plan.

    Comprehensive Neighborhood Planning
We believe that the people who live, work, and play in a place are the ones who should lead the process of shaping how development happens: what are the sacred places that should be preserved, what needs to be strengthened or enhanced, and what new things need to be brought into a neighborhood to facilitate equitable community and economic development for all?
 

Northeast Water Front Community Plan 
As San Francisco’s Waterfront continues to develop, it is critical that the cultural character and resources that make the waterfront special be maintained and enhanced. In 2010, residents, youth and seniors, local merchants, and tenant and neighborhood organizations from San Francisco’s Northeast Waterfront together created a Vision that emerged from this diverse community’s desire for a comprehensive plan that addresses issues not emphasized by official City planning processes. This document presents a Vision of the Northeast Waterfront as a necklace of intimate green spaces, between a low-rise mix of commercial, residential, cultural, and recreational uses that honor the Waterfront’s history and topography, connected back to the City’s neighborhoods through strong pedestrian-friendly streets. The community planning process that led to this Vision was guided by several principles developed by the community:

Begin with People      and Place,      not abstract planning “concepts.” Sense      of place is defined by the people who live, work and play in a      particular place. The      waterfront is not just a destination, but also part of neighborhood fabric      of Golden Gateway, Chinatown, North Beach, and Telegraph Hill. Strengthen      neighborhood connections, including the cultural/ethnic relationship      between Chinatown and waterfront. Public      improvements and private development should integrate with and contribute      to existing neighborhood fabric along the Northeast Waterfront.
Plan for a      harmonious, socio-economic and ethnically diverse waterfront. Take a comprehensive look at planning for      people, including Transit,      Parking, Recreation, Economics, and Equity issues. Development should be accessible to all, including      residents, visitors and those who work nearby. Affordable housing should      be a priority for both families and seniors. 
Enhance and preserve      the community’s recreation opportunities, especially the recreation, education and cultural performance      needs of Chinatown and North Beach youth; and preserve the Gateway’s      recreation center as the community resource it was designed to be.
Plan for the future      of the NE Waterfront as a whole, not just      priorities for developers. Balance uses that      are revenue-generating with public open space and active recreation uses across      all the Northeast Waterfront’s Seawall Lots in order to produce a plan      that is both financially and politically feasible.
Reach      Consensus from a wide range of stakeholders representing the interests of residents,      workers, merchants, youth and seniors from the different communities of      the Northeast Waterfront, as well as visitors and downtown workers.

Western SoMa Community Plan 
 The Western South of Market Citizens Planning Task Force seeks to maintain and enhance the living, historic and sustainable neighborhood character of Western SoMa’s cultural and economic diversity. AND worked closely with the Task Force and Planning Department staff in the development of the Community Plan, providing facilitation, analysis, and mapping necessary for a comprehensive plan, as well as developing a set of “Strategic Analysis Memos” to support the plan. >Download Western SoMa Draft Plan (pdf) 

 
SoMa Youth & Family Zone 
AND has worked in partnership with SOMCAN over many years, providing impacts analysis of the Rincon Hill developments that led to the creation of a $34 Million SoMa Community Stabilization Fund, and our ongoing collaboration to help build the vision for the Youth & Family Zone. This vision lays out how the community can grow and benefit from the rapid development hap­pening in SoMa, addressing the needs of local families for affordable housing, jobs for youth and young adults, pedestrian safety, open space, and community-serving businesses, incorporating a broad definition of families to include extended, senior, non-traditional, and LGBTQ families

Mission District People's Plan
The People's Plan for Jobs, Housing & Community, developed with the  Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition, proposes an alternative for the Planning Department's "Eastern Neighborhoods" project. Developed through a participatory planning process involving over 200 community residents and intensive community organizing, the plan outlines goals and objectives for protecting existing rent-controlled housing, blue-collar jobs, and critical services and cultural resources, and promoting affordable housing and equitable development. AND provided supporting research and documents for the People’s Plan, which was analyzed as a plan alternative in the city’s EIR, and continues to work with Mission organizations in the implementation of the plan.

    Comprehensive Neighborhood Planning
We believe that the people who live, work, and play in a place are the ones who should lead the process of shaping how development happens: what are the sacred places that should be preserved, what needs to be strengthened or enhanced, and what new things need to be brought into a neighborhood to facilitate equitable community and economic development for all?
 

Northeast Water Front Community Plan 
As San Francisco’s Waterfront continues to develop, it is critical that the cultural character and resources that make the waterfront special be maintained and enhanced. In 2010, residents, youth and seniors, local merchants, and tenant and neighborhood organizations from San Francisco’s Northeast Waterfront together created a Vision that emerged from this diverse community’s desire for a comprehensive plan that addresses issues not emphasized by official City planning processes. This document presents a Vision of the Northeast Waterfront as a necklace of intimate green spaces, between a low-rise mix of commercial, residential, cultural, and recreational uses that honor the Waterfront’s history and topography, connected back to the City’s neighborhoods through strong pedestrian-friendly streets. The community planning process that led to this Vision was guided by several principles developed by the community:

Begin with People      and Place,      not abstract planning “concepts.” Sense      of place is defined by the people who live, work and play in a      particular place. The      waterfront is not just a destination, but also part of neighborhood fabric      of Golden Gateway, Chinatown, North Beach, and Telegraph Hill. Strengthen      neighborhood connections, including the cultural/ethnic relationship      between Chinatown and waterfront. Public      improvements and private development should integrate with and contribute      to existing neighborhood fabric along the Northeast Waterfront.
Plan for a      harmonious, socio-economic and ethnically diverse waterfront. Take a comprehensive look at planning for      people, including Transit,      Parking, Recreation, Economics, and Equity issues. Development should be accessible to all, including      residents, visitors and those who work nearby. Affordable housing should      be a priority for both families and seniors. 
Enhance and preserve      the community’s recreation opportunities, especially the recreation, education and cultural performance      needs of Chinatown and North Beach youth; and preserve the Gateway’s      recreation center as the community resource it was designed to be.
Plan for the future      of the NE Waterfront as a whole, not just      priorities for developers. Balance uses that      are revenue-generating with public open space and active recreation uses across      all the Northeast Waterfront’s Seawall Lots in order to produce a plan      that is both financially and politically feasible.
Reach      Consensus from a wide range of stakeholders representing the interests of residents,      workers, merchants, youth and seniors from the different communities of      the Northeast Waterfront, as well as visitors and downtown workers.

Western SoMa Community Plan 
 The Western South of Market Citizens Planning Task Force seeks to maintain and enhance the living, historic and sustainable neighborhood character of Western SoMa’s cultural and economic diversity. AND worked closely with the Task Force and Planning Department staff in the development of the Community Plan, providing facilitation, analysis, and mapping necessary for a comprehensive plan, as well as developing a set of “Strategic Analysis Memos” to support the plan. >Download Western SoMa Draft Plan (pdf) 

 
SoMa Youth & Family Zone 
AND has worked in partnership with SOMCAN over many years, providing impacts analysis of the Rincon Hill developments that led to the creation of a $34 Million SoMa Community Stabilization Fund, and our ongoing collaboration to help build the vision for the Youth & Family Zone. This vision lays out how the community can grow and benefit from the rapid development hap­pening in SoMa, addressing the needs of local families for affordable housing, jobs for youth and young adults, pedestrian safety, open space, and community-serving businesses, incorporating a broad definition of families to include extended, senior, non-traditional, and LGBTQ families

Mission District People's Plan
The People's Plan for Jobs, Housing & Community, developed with the  Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition, proposes an alternative for the Planning Department's "Eastern Neighborhoods" project. Developed through a participatory planning process involving over 200 community residents and intensive community organizing, the plan outlines goals and objectives for protecting existing rent-controlled housing, blue-collar jobs, and critical services and cultural resources, and promoting affordable housing and equitable development. AND provided supporting research and documents for the People’s Plan, which was analyzed as a plan alternative in the city’s EIR, and continues to work with Mission organizations in the implementation of the plan.

    Comprehensive Neighborhood Planning
We believe that the people who live, work, and play in a place are the ones who should lead the process of shaping how development happens: what are the sacred places that should be preserved, what needs to be strengthened or enhanced, and what new things need to be brought into a neighborhood to facilitate equitable community and economic development for all?
 

Northeast Water Front Community Plan 
As San Francisco’s Waterfront continues to develop, it is critical that the cultural character and resources that make the waterfront special be maintained and enhanced. In 2010, residents, youth and seniors, local merchants, and tenant and neighborhood organizations from San Francisco’s Northeast Waterfront together created a Vision that emerged from this diverse community’s desire for a comprehensive plan that addresses issues not emphasized by official City planning processes. This document presents a Vision of the Northeast Waterfront as a necklace of intimate green spaces, between a low-rise mix of commercial, residential, cultural, and recreational uses that honor the Waterfront’s history and topography, connected back to the City’s neighborhoods through strong pedestrian-friendly streets. The community planning process that led to this Vision was guided by several principles developed by the community:

Begin with People      and Place,      not abstract planning “concepts.” Sense      of place is defined by the people who live, work and play in a      particular place. The      waterfront is not just a destination, but also part of neighborhood fabric      of Golden Gateway, Chinatown, North Beach, and Telegraph Hill. Strengthen      neighborhood connections, including the cultural/ethnic relationship      between Chinatown and waterfront. Public      improvements and private development should integrate with and contribute      to existing neighborhood fabric along the Northeast Waterfront.
Plan for a      harmonious, socio-economic and ethnically diverse waterfront. Take a comprehensive look at planning for      people, including Transit,      Parking, Recreation, Economics, and Equity issues. Development should be accessible to all, including      residents, visitors and those who work nearby. Affordable housing should      be a priority for both families and seniors. 
Enhance and preserve      the community’s recreation opportunities, especially the recreation, education and cultural performance      needs of Chinatown and North Beach youth; and preserve the Gateway’s      recreation center as the community resource it was designed to be.
Plan for the future      of the NE Waterfront as a whole, not just      priorities for developers. Balance uses that      are revenue-generating with public open space and active recreation uses across      all the Northeast Waterfront’s Seawall Lots in order to produce a plan      that is both financially and politically feasible.
Reach      Consensus from a wide range of stakeholders representing the interests of residents,      workers, merchants, youth and seniors from the different communities of      the Northeast Waterfront, as well as visitors and downtown workers.

Western SoMa Community Plan 
 The Western South of Market Citizens Planning Task Force seeks to maintain and enhance the living, historic and sustainable neighborhood character of Western SoMa’s cultural and economic diversity. AND worked closely with the Task Force and Planning Department staff in the development of the Community Plan, providing facilitation, analysis, and mapping necessary for a comprehensive plan, as well as developing a set of “Strategic Analysis Memos” to support the plan. >Download Western SoMa Draft Plan (pdf) 

 
SoMa Youth & Family Zone 
AND has worked in partnership with SOMCAN over many years, providing impacts analysis of the Rincon Hill developments that led to the creation of a $34 Million SoMa Community Stabilization Fund, and our ongoing collaboration to help build the vision for the Youth & Family Zone. This vision lays out how the community can grow and benefit from the rapid development hap­pening in SoMa, addressing the needs of local families for affordable housing, jobs for youth and young adults, pedestrian safety, open space, and community-serving businesses, incorporating a broad definition of families to include extended, senior, non-traditional, and LGBTQ families

Mission District People's Plan
The People's Plan for Jobs, Housing & Community, developed with the  Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition, proposes an alternative for the Planning Department's "Eastern Neighborhoods" project. Developed through a participatory planning process involving over 200 community residents and intensive community organizing, the plan outlines goals and objectives for protecting existing rent-controlled housing, blue-collar jobs, and critical services and cultural resources, and promoting affordable housing and equitable development. AND provided supporting research and documents for the People’s Plan, which was analyzed as a plan alternative in the city’s EIR, and continues to work with Mission organizations in the implementation of the plan.

    Comprehensive Neighborhood Planning
We believe that the people who live, work, and play in a place are the ones who should lead the process of shaping how development happens: what are the sacred places that should be preserved, what needs to be strengthened or enhanced, and what new things need to be brought into a neighborhood to facilitate equitable community and economic development for all?
 

Northeast Water Front Community Plan 
As San Francisco’s Waterfront continues to develop, it is critical that the cultural character and resources that make the waterfront special be maintained and enhanced. In 2010, residents, youth and seniors, local merchants, and tenant and neighborhood organizations from San Francisco’s Northeast Waterfront together created a Vision that emerged from this diverse community’s desire for a comprehensive plan that addresses issues not emphasized by official City planning processes. This document presents a Vision of the Northeast Waterfront as a necklace of intimate green spaces, between a low-rise mix of commercial, residential, cultural, and recreational uses that honor the Waterfront’s history and topography, connected back to the City’s neighborhoods through strong pedestrian-friendly streets. The community planning process that led to this Vision was guided by several principles developed by the community:

Begin with People      and Place,      not abstract planning “concepts.” Sense      of place is defined by the people who live, work and play in a      particular place. The      waterfront is not just a destination, but also part of neighborhood fabric      of Golden Gateway, Chinatown, North Beach, and Telegraph Hill. Strengthen      neighborhood connections, including the cultural/ethnic relationship      between Chinatown and waterfront. Public      improvements and private development should integrate with and contribute      to existing neighborhood fabric along the Northeast Waterfront.
Plan for a      harmonious, socio-economic and ethnically diverse waterfront. Take a comprehensive look at planning for      people, including Transit,      Parking, Recreation, Economics, and Equity issues. Development should be accessible to all, including      residents, visitors and those who work nearby. Affordable housing should      be a priority for both families and seniors. 
Enhance and preserve      the community’s recreation opportunities, especially the recreation, education and cultural performance      needs of Chinatown and North Beach youth; and preserve the Gateway’s      recreation center as the community resource it was designed to be.
Plan for the future      of the NE Waterfront as a whole, not just      priorities for developers. Balance uses that      are revenue-generating with public open space and active recreation uses across      all the Northeast Waterfront’s Seawall Lots in order to produce a plan      that is both financially and politically feasible.
Reach      Consensus from a wide range of stakeholders representing the interests of residents,      workers, merchants, youth and seniors from the different communities of      the Northeast Waterfront, as well as visitors and downtown workers.

Western SoMa Community Plan 
 The Western South of Market Citizens Planning Task Force seeks to maintain and enhance the living, historic and sustainable neighborhood character of Western SoMa’s cultural and economic diversity. AND worked closely with the Task Force and Planning Department staff in the development of the Community Plan, providing facilitation, analysis, and mapping necessary for a comprehensive plan, as well as developing a set of “Strategic Analysis Memos” to support the plan. >Download Western SoMa Draft Plan (pdf) 

 
SoMa Youth & Family Zone 
AND has worked in partnership with SOMCAN over many years, providing impacts analysis of the Rincon Hill developments that led to the creation of a $34 Million SoMa Community Stabilization Fund, and our ongoing collaboration to help build the vision for the Youth & Family Zone. This vision lays out how the community can grow and benefit from the rapid development hap­pening in SoMa, addressing the needs of local families for affordable housing, jobs for youth and young adults, pedestrian safety, open space, and community-serving businesses, incorporating a broad definition of families to include extended, senior, non-traditional, and LGBTQ families

Mission District People's Plan
The People's Plan for Jobs, Housing & Community, developed with the  Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition, proposes an alternative for the Planning Department's "Eastern Neighborhoods" project. Developed through a participatory planning process involving over 200 community residents and intensive community organizing, the plan outlines goals and objectives for protecting existing rent-controlled housing, blue-collar jobs, and critical services and cultural resources, and promoting affordable housing and equitable development. AND provided supporting research and documents for the People’s Plan, which was analyzed as a plan alternative in the city’s EIR, and continues to work with Mission organizations in the implementation of the plan.

    Comprehensive Neighborhood Planning
We believe that the people who live, work, and play in a place are the ones who should lead the process of shaping how development happens: what are the sacred places that should be preserved, what needs to be strengthened or enhanced, and what new things need to be brought into a neighborhood to facilitate equitable community and economic development for all?
 

Northeast Water Front Community Plan 
As San Francisco’s Waterfront continues to develop, it is critical that the cultural character and resources that make the waterfront special be maintained and enhanced. In 2010, residents, youth and seniors, local merchants, and tenant and neighborhood organizations from San Francisco’s Northeast Waterfront together created a Vision that emerged from this diverse community’s desire for a comprehensive plan that addresses issues not emphasized by official City planning processes. This document presents a Vision of the Northeast Waterfront as a necklace of intimate green spaces, between a low-rise mix of commercial, residential, cultural, and recreational uses that honor the Waterfront’s history and topography, connected back to the City’s neighborhoods through strong pedestrian-friendly streets. The community planning process that led to this Vision was guided by several principles developed by the community:

Begin with People      and Place,      not abstract planning “concepts.” Sense      of place is defined by the people who live, work and play in a      particular place. The      waterfront is not just a destination, but also part of neighborhood fabric      of Golden Gateway, Chinatown, North Beach, and Telegraph Hill. Strengthen      neighborhood connections, including the cultural/ethnic relationship      between Chinatown and waterfront. Public      improvements and private development should integrate with and contribute      to existing neighborhood fabric along the Northeast Waterfront.
Plan for a      harmonious, socio-economic and ethnically diverse waterfront. Take a comprehensive look at planning for      people, including Transit,      Parking, Recreation, Economics, and Equity issues. Development should be accessible to all, including      residents, visitors and those who work nearby. Affordable housing should      be a priority for both families and seniors. 
Enhance and preserve      the community’s recreation opportunities, especially the recreation, education and cultural performance      needs of Chinatown and North Beach youth; and preserve the Gateway’s      recreation center as the community resource it was designed to be.
Plan for the future      of the NE Waterfront as a whole, not just      priorities for developers. Balance uses that      are revenue-generating with public open space and active recreation uses across      all the Northeast Waterfront’s Seawall Lots in order to produce a plan      that is both financially and politically feasible.
Reach      Consensus from a wide range of stakeholders representing the interests of residents,      workers, merchants, youth and seniors from the different communities of      the Northeast Waterfront, as well as visitors and downtown workers.

Western SoMa Community Plan 
 The Western South of Market Citizens Planning Task Force seeks to maintain and enhance the living, historic and sustainable neighborhood character of Western SoMa’s cultural and economic diversity. AND worked closely with the Task Force and Planning Department staff in the development of the Community Plan, providing facilitation, analysis, and mapping necessary for a comprehensive plan, as well as developing a set of “Strategic Analysis Memos” to support the plan. >Download Western SoMa Draft Plan (pdf) 

 
SoMa Youth & Family Zone 
AND has worked in partnership with SOMCAN over many years, providing impacts analysis of the Rincon Hill developments that led to the creation of a $34 Million SoMa Community Stabilization Fund, and our ongoing collaboration to help build the vision for the Youth & Family Zone. This vision lays out how the community can grow and benefit from the rapid development hap­pening in SoMa, addressing the needs of local families for affordable housing, jobs for youth and young adults, pedestrian safety, open space, and community-serving businesses, incorporating a broad definition of families to include extended, senior, non-traditional, and LGBTQ families

Mission District People's Plan
The People's Plan for Jobs, Housing & Community, developed with the  Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition, proposes an alternative for the Planning Department's "Eastern Neighborhoods" project. Developed through a participatory planning process involving over 200 community residents and intensive community organizing, the plan outlines goals and objectives for protecting existing rent-controlled housing, blue-collar jobs, and critical services and cultural resources, and promoting affordable housing and equitable development. AND provided supporting research and documents for the People’s Plan, which was analyzed as a plan alternative in the city’s EIR, and continues to work with Mission organizations in the implementation of the plan.
