Health & Childcare Facilities
Friendship House Healing Center  
The Friendship House Association of American Indians of San Francisco has had facilities located on Julian Avenue in San Francisco's Mission District historically for many years. In 2001 they purchased property on the same street and their dreams to consolidate their programs and meeting spaces into the Friendship House Healing Center started to become a reality. The new facility contains a licensed residential care, offices and a clinic. The ground floor contains a large entry landscaped area with sweat lodge, basketball court, parking, commercial kitchen and the "Great Hall" where several hundred people meet for holiday celebrations. The second and third floors house the residential care program and the offices and clinic are located on the fourth floor.
