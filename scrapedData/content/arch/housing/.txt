Housing
Peacock Commons 
Working with the nonprofit Bill Wilson Center, AND completely renovated a rundown apartment complex, creating the first housing development for emancipated youth on the West Coast. Peacock Commons provides residences for as many as 45 transition-age youth, including youth aging out of the foster care system, youth with children, youth with a mental health diagnosis and victims of domestic violence. Six adult mentors live onsite, providing 10-15 hours a month of services such as organizing social activities and classes.
A model for sustainability, the project incorporates green components such as solar-powered heat and lighting systems and energy-efficient windows. All new paving and drought tolerant landscaping were also included.
Awards: 2012 SEED Awards for Excellence in Public Interest Design Honorable Mention.
Oak Park Apartments 
The Oak Park Apartments project involves the renovation of an apartment complex that contained 56 one-bedroom units in six separate buildings surrounding a courtyard. The project sponsor, 26th Ave. Housing Associates (an association between East Bay Asian Local Development Corporation (EBALDC) and Affordable Housing Associates (AHA)), renovated the project to accommodate low-income families and reconfigured the apartments into 37 one, two, three and four bedroom units to relieve the overcrowding of several family generations in one apartment that now exists. Additionally, a new Community Building was constructed in the area currently used for parking. This building includes a multipurpose room with residential kitchen, computer room, resident manager office, two accessible toilets, and two private study rooms.
The building transforms the existing “motel” aesthetic and creates a new residential design through the installation of a new hipped roof, new windows and a new entry “portals” into the complex.
On the Boards | Affordable Housing - Renovation 
AND is currently collaborating with San Francisco Community Land Trust, Chinatown Community Development Center, and Mission Economic Development Agency to rehabilitate apartments with 5-25 units through the Small Sites Program (SSP), a mission-driven acquisition and rehabilitation program working to preserve affordable housing for low to moderate income households in San Francisco. Scope of work varies per site but includes interior renovation of kitchen and bathroom, exterior and facade renovation, and accessibility upgrades. Projects are also in different stages from schematic/design development, construction documents, to plan check review process.
