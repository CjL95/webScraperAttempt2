Housing > Peacock Commons
Working with the nonprofit Bill Wilson Center, AND completely renovated a rundown apartment complex, creating the first housing development for emancipated youth on the West Coast. Peacock Commons provides residences for as many as 45 transition-age youth, including youth aging out of the foster care system, youth with children, youth with a mental health diagnosis and victims of domestic violence. Six adult mentors live onsite, providing 10-15 hours a month of services such as organizing social activities and classes.
A model for sustainability, the project incorporates green components such as solar-powered heat and lighting systems and energy-efficient windows. All new paving and drought tolerant landscaping were also included.
