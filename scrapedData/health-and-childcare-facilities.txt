              Friendship House Healing Center  

              

                

                The Friendship House Association of American Indians of San Francisco has had facilities located on Julian Avenue in San Francisco's Mission District historically for many years. In 2001 they purchased property on the same street and their dreams to consolidate their programs and meeting spaces into the Friendship House Healing Center started to become a reality. The new facility contains a licensed residential care, offices and a clinic. The ground floor contains a large entry landscaped area with sweat lodge, basketball court, parking, commercial kitchen and the "Great Hall" where several hundred people meet for holiday celebrations. The second and third floors house the residential care program and the offices and clinic are located on the fourth floor.

                The Children's Campus is a new 8,000 square feet customized modular childcare project with two classrooms each for infants, toddlers and preschoolers. The modular building is constructed on a pre-engineered concrete foundation with a crawl space to allow direct disabled access at the entry and between classrooms and the exterior play areas. Classrooms include teacher support areas with kitchen appliances and desks for teacher preparation, direct access to children's toilets and separate nap rooms for infants.

              ON THE BOARDS | H.U.G. PRESCHOOL 

              

                

                Located in the heart of San Francisco’s Sunset District, HUG (Help-U-Grow) preschool will provide a safe and nurturing environment for preschoolers cultivated through the values and ministry of the Lutheran Church of the Holy Spirit. Providing a STREAM curriculum of Science, Technology, Reading, Engineering, Art, and Math, the preschool is located in a converted one-story, 2,500 square foot commercial space with 1,200 square foot rear yard for up to 50 children and a staff of 9.
AND’s involvement began with initial concept and feasibility studies with church staff to assess code and physical spatial parameters of the building. A final report, including cost estimate, was provided to the church building committee who then undertook a 2-year capital fundraising campaign for the construction of the school. The project is now in Design Development in preparation for permit and construction drawings and specifications. Targeted construction completion and opening is targeted for Winter/Spring 2018.

              

              

              

            

             

          

        

          

            

            

              ON THE BOARDS | WESTSIDE CHILD DEVELOPMENT CENTER PLAYGROUND 

              

                

                Westside Child Development Center’s Playground is located on the south side of Westside Courts. The renovated playground will provide a new play structure, storage, planters, water + sand play area, and trike path. It provides additional zones for the children to play and it will be open to residents of Westside Courts and the neighboring community as well.  The project is currently in the permit plan check stage and is anticipated to complete construction in Fall 2017.

                The Friendship House Association of American Indians of San Francisco has had facilities located on Julian Avenue in San Francisco's Mission District historically for many years.

The new facility contains a licensed residential care, offices and a clinic. The ground floor contains a large entry landscaped area with sweat lodge, basketball court, parking, commercial kitchen and the "Great Hall" where several hundred people meet for holiday celebrations. The second and third floors house the residential care program and the offices and clinic are located on the fourth floor.

              ON THE BOARDS | H.U.G. PRESCHOOL 

              

                

                Located in the heart of San Francisco’s Sunset District, HUG (Help-U-Grow) preschool will provide a safe and nurturing environment for preschoolers cultivated through the values and ministry of the Lutheran Church of the Holy Spirit. Providing a STREAM curriculum of Science, Technology, Reading, Engineering, Art, and Math, the preschool is located in a converted one-story, 2,500 square foot commercial space with 1,200 square foot rear yard for up to 50 children and a staff of 9.
AND’s involvement began with initial concept and feasibility studies with church staff to assess code and physical spatial parameters of the building. A final report, including cost estimate, was provided to the church building committee who then undertook a 2-year capital fundraising campaign for the construction of the school. The project is now in Design Development in preparation for permit and construction drawings and specifications. Targeted construction completion and opening is targeted for Winter/Spring 2018.

              Friendship House Healing Center  

              

                

                The Friendship House Association of American Indians of San Francisco has had facilities located on Julian Avenue in San Francisco's Mission District historically for many years. In 2001 they purchased property on the same street and their dreams to consolidate their programs and meeting spaces into the Friendship House Healing Center started to become a reality. The new facility contains a licensed residential care, offices and a clinic. The ground floor contains a large entry landscaped area with sweat lodge, basketball court, parking, commercial kitchen and the "Great Hall" where several hundred people meet for holiday celebrations. The second and third floors house the residential care program and the offices and clinic are located on the fourth floor.

              ON THE BOARDS | H.U.G. PRESCHOOL 

              

                

                Located in the heart of San Francisco’s Sunset District, HUG (Help-U-Grow) preschool will provide a safe and nurturing environment for preschoolers cultivated through the values and ministry of the Lutheran Church of the Holy Spirit. Providing a STREAM curriculum of Science, Technology, Reading, Engineering, Art, and Math, the preschool is located in a converted one-story, 2,500 square foot commercial space with 1,200 square foot rear yard for up to 50 children and a staff of 9.
AND’s involvement began with initial concept and feasibility studies with church staff to assess code and physical spatial parameters of the building. A final report, including cost estimate, was provided to the church building committee who then undertook a 2-year capital fundraising campaign for the construction of the school. The project is now in Design Development in preparation for permit and construction drawings and specifications. Targeted construction completion and opening is targeted for Winter/Spring 2018.

              Friendship House Healing Center  

              

                

                The Friendship House Association of American Indians of San Francisco has had facilities located on Julian Avenue in San Francisco's Mission District historically for many years. In 2001 they purchased property on the same street and their dreams to consolidate their programs and meeting spaces into the Friendship House Healing Center started to become a reality. The new facility contains a licensed residential care, offices and a clinic. The ground floor contains a large entry landscaped area with sweat lodge, basketball court, parking, commercial kitchen and the "Great Hall" where several hundred people meet for holiday celebrations. The second and third floors house the residential care program and the offices and clinic are located on the fourth floor.

                The Children's Campus is a new 8,000 square feet customized modular childcare project with two classrooms each for infants, toddlers and preschoolers. The modular building is constructed on a pre-engineered concrete foundation with a crawl space to allow direct disabled access at the entry and between classrooms and the exterior play areas. Classrooms include teacher support areas with kitchen appliances and desks for teacher preparation, direct access to children's toilets and separate nap rooms for infants. The modular building incorporates sustainable materials with efficient gas-powered mechanical systems, linoleum flooring, cement fiber-board siding, low-voc paints and solartube skylights.

              ON THE BOARDS | H.U.G. PRESCHOOL 

              

                

                Located in the heart of San Francisco’s Sunset District, HUG (Help-U-Grow) preschool will provide a safe and nurturing environment for preschoolers cultivated through the values and ministry of the Lutheran Church of the Holy Spirit. Providing a STREAM curriculum of Science, Technology, Reading, Engineering, Art, and Math, the preschool is located in a converted one-story, 2,500 square foot commercial space with 1,200 square foot rear yard for up to 50 children and a staff of 9.
AND’s involvement began with initial concept and feasibility studies with church staff to assess code and physical spatial parameters of the building. A final report, including cost estimate, was provided to the church building committee who then undertook a 2-year capital fundraising campaign for the construction of the school. The project is now in Design Development in preparation for permit and construction drawings and specifications. Targeted construction completion and opening is targeted for Winter/Spring 2018.

              Friendship House Healing Center  

              

                

                The Friendship House Association of American Indians of San Francisco has had facilities located on Julian Avenue in San Francisco's Mission District historically for many years. In 2001 they purchased property on the same street and their dreams to consolidate their programs and meeting spaces into the Friendship House Healing Center started to become a reality. The new facility contains a licensed residential care, offices and a clinic. The ground floor contains a large entry landscaped area with sweat lodge, basketball court, parking, commercial kitchen and the "Great Hall" where several hundred people meet for holiday celebrations. The second and third floors house the residential care program and the offices and clinic are located on the fourth floor.

              ON THE BOARDS | H.U.G. PRESCHOOL 

              

                

                Located in the heart of San Francisco’s Sunset District, HUG (Help-U-Grow) preschool will provide a safe and nurturing environment for preschoolers cultivated through the values and ministry of the Lutheran Church of the Holy Spirit. Providing a STREAM curriculum of Science, Technology, Reading, Engineering, Art, and Math, the preschool is located in a converted one-story, 2,500 square foot commercial space with 1,200 square foot rear yard for up to 50 children and a staff of 9.
AND’s involvement began with initial concept and feasibility studies with church staff to assess code and physical spatial parameters of the building. A final report, including cost estimate, was provided to the church building committee who then undertook a 2-year capital fundraising campaign for the construction of the school. The project is now in Design Development in preparation for permit and construction drawings and specifications. Targeted construction completion and opening is targeted for Winter/Spring 2018.

                The Friendship House Association of American Indians of San Francisco has had facilities located on Julian Avenue in San Francisco's Mission District historically for many years. In 2001 they purchased property on the same street and their dreams to consolidate their programs and meeting spaces into the Friendship House Healing Center started to become a reality. The new facility contains a licensed residential care, offices and a clinic. The ground floor contains a large entry landscaped area with sweat lodge, basketball court, parking, commercial kitchen and the "Great Hall" where several hundred people meet for holiday celebrations. The second and third floors house the residential care program and the offices and clinic are located on the fourth floor.

              ON THE BOARDS | H.U.G. PRESCHOOL 

              

                

                Located in the heart of San Francisco’s Sunset District, HUG (Help-U-Grow) preschool will provide a safe and nurturing environment for preschoolers cultivated through the values and ministry of the Lutheran Church of the Holy Spirit. Providing a STREAM curriculum of Science, Technology, Reading, Engineering, Art, and Math, the preschool is located in a converted one-story, 2,500 square foot commercial space with 1,200 square foot rear yard for up to 50 children and a staff of 9.
AND’s involvement began with initial concept and feasibility studies with church staff to assess code and physical spatial parameters of the building. A final report, including cost estimate, was provided to the church building committee who then undertook a 2-year capital fundraising campaign for the construction of the school. The project is now in Design Development in preparation for permit and construction drawings and specifications. Targeted construction completion and opening is targeted for Winter/Spring 2018.
