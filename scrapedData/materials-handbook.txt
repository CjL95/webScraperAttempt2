    Materials Handbook
Created in collaboration with AND staff and SF Mayor's Office of Housing staff, the content of this handbook compiles the information and input of hundreds of Bay Area affordable housing practitioners. Non-profit developers, architects, city officails, property management staff and builders whose knowledge and experience has been essential to the creation and management of thousands of quality affordable housing units in the Bay Area have been consulted to make this available. 
The purpose of the Handbook is to share knowledge about building materials and design strategies that have been used sucessfully to create healthy, high quality, sustainable affordable housing for low-income people in San Francisco.

    Materials Handbook
Created in collaboration with AND staff and SF Mayor's Office of Housing staff, the content of this handbook compiles the information and input of hundreds of Bay Area affordable housing practitioners. Non-profit developers, architects, city officails, property management staff and builders whose knowledge and experience has been essential to the creation and management of thousands of quality affordable housing units in the Bay Area have been consulted to make this available. 
The purpose of the Handbook is to share knowledge about building materials and design strategies that have been used sucessfully to create healthy, high quality, sustainable affordable housing for low-income people in San Francisco.

    Materials Handbook
Created in collaboration with AND staff and SF Mayor's Office of Housing staff, the content of this handbook compiles the information and input of hundreds of Bay Area affordable housing practitioners. Non-profit developers, architects, city officails, property management staff and builders whose knowledge and experience has been essential to the creation and management of thousands of quality affordable housing units in the Bay Area have been consulted to make this available. 
The purpose of the Handbook is to share knowledge about building materials and design strategies that have been used sucessfully to create healthy, high quality, sustainable affordable housing for low-income people in San Francisco.
